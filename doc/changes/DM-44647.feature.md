Add new show_dot functionality.

This PR refactors the existing pipeline graph show function, implementing a new `parse_display_args` function to handle the parsing of the `--dot` argument.
The `show_dot` function is then implemented to display the pipeline graph as a dot file.
A notable user-visible change is that output dataset types with common dimensions and storage classes will now be grouped together in dot files.
This change was implemented in order to save space for otherwise very large dot files.
