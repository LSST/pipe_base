Several changes to API to add support for `QuantumBackedButler`:
* `QuantumGraph` class adds `globalInitOutputRefs` method which returns global per-graph output dataset references (e.g. for "packages" dataset type).
* `ButlerQuantumContext` can work with either `Butler` or `LimitedButler`.
  Its `__init__` method should not be used directly, instead one of the two new class methods should be used - `from_full` or `from_limited`.
* `ButlerQuantumContext.registry` attribute was removed, `ButlerQuantumContext.dimensions` is added to hold `DimensionUniverse`.
* Abstract method `TaskFactory.makeTask` was updated and simplified to accept `TaskDef` and `LimitedButler`.
