Add the `QuantumSuccessCaveats` flag enum, which can be used to report on `NoWorkFound` and other qualified successes in execution.

This adds the flag enum itself and functionality in `QuantumProvenanceGraph` (which backs `pipetask report --force-v2`) to include it in reports.
It relies on additional changes in `lsst.ctrl.mpexec.SingleQuantumExecutor` to write the caveat flags into task metadata.
