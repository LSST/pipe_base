When looking up prerequisite inputs with skypix data IDs (e.g. reference catalogs) for a quantum whose data ID is not spatial, use the union of the spatial regions of the input and output datasets as a constraint.

This keeps global sequence-point tasks from being given all such datasets in the input collections.
