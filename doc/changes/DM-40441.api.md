Deprecate various interfaces that have been obsoleted by `PipelineGraph`.

The most prominent deprecations are:

- the `Pipeline.toExpandedPipeline`, as well as iteration and task-label indexing for `Pipeline`;
- the `PipelineDatasetTypes` and `TaskDatasetTypes` classes;
- the old `GraphBuilder` interface for building `QuantumGraph` objects.
