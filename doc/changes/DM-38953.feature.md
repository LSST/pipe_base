Formalize support for modifying connections in `PipelineTaskConnections.__init__` implementations.

Connections can now be added, removed, or replaced with normal attribute syntax.
Removing entries from e.g. `self.inputs` in `__init__` still works for backwards compatibility, but deleting attributes is generally preferred.
The task dimensions can also be replaced or modified in place in `__init__`.
