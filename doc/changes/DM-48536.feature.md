`QuantumProvenanceGraph` and `pipetask report --force-v2` can now report on exceptions raised and then ignored via the `--no-raise-on-partial-outputs` option.

Exceptions that lead to task failures are not yet tracked, because we do not write task metadata for failures and hence have nowhere to put the information.
