Add functionality to aggregate multiple `QuantumProvenanceGraph.Summary`
objects into one `Summary` for a wholistic report.

While the `QuantumProvenanceGraph` was designed to resolve processing over
dataquery-identified groups, `QuantumProvenanceGraph.aggregate` is designed to
combine multiple group-level reports into one which totals the successes,
issues and failures over the same section of pipeline.
