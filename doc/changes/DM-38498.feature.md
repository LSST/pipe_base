Rewrite quantum graph generation.

The new algorithm is much faster, more extensible, and easier to maintain (especially when storage-class conversions are present in a pipeline).
It also allows `PipelineTasks` to raise `NoWorkFound` or otherwise restrict their outputs during quantum-graph generation and immediately affect the downstream graph.
