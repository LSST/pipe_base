    all of them so that attributes could potentially be modified in place
    (e.g. if configuration needs extra overrides).

    Attributes
    ----------
    taskName : `str`
        `PipelineTask` class name, currently it is not specified whether this
        is a fully-qualified name or partial name (e.g. ``module.TaskClass``).
        Framework should be prepared to handle all cases.
    config : `lsst.pex.config.Config`
        Instance of the configuration class corresponding to this task class,
        usually with all overrides applied.
    taskClass : `type` or ``None``
        `PipelineTask` class object, can be ``None``. If ``None`` then
        framework will have to locate and load class.
    label : `str`, optional
        Task label, usually a short string unique in a pipeline.

    Pipeline is given as one of the inputs to a supervising framework
    which builds execution graph out of it. Pipeline contains a sequence
    of `TaskDef` instances.

    Main purpose of this class is to provide a mechanism to pass pipeline
    definition from users to supervising framework. That mechanism is
    implemented using simple serialization and de-serialization via
    `pickle`. Note that pipeline serialization is not guaranteed to be
    compatible between different versions or releases.

    In current implementation Pipeline is a list (it inherits from `list`)
    and one can use all list methods on pipeline. Content of the pipeline
    can be modified, it is up to the client to verify that modifications
    leave pipeline in a consistent state. One could modify container
    directly by adding or removing its elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipeline : iterable of `TaskDef` instances, optional
        Initial sequence of tasks.
